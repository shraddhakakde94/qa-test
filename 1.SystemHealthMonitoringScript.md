### Execution Instructions ###
## Objective: System Health Monitoring Script

**Objective:**
   - Develop a script that monitors the health of a Linux system.
   - It should check CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes.
   - If any of these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%), the script should send an alert to the console or a log file.

1. **System Health Monitoring Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `system_health_monitor.py`.
   - Run the system health monitoring script:
     ```
     python system_health_monitor.py
     ```
   - The script will monitor CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes on the system.

2. **Additional Notes:**
   - Adjust thresholds (`CPU_THRESHOLD`, `MEMORY_THRESHOLD`, `DISK_THRESHOLD`) in the script as needed based on your system requirements.
   - Ensure Python 3.x and necessary packages (`psutil`) are installed.
