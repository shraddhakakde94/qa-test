### Execution Instructions ###
## Objective: Application Health Checker

 **Objective:**
    - Write a script that checks the uptime of an application by assessing its status through HTTP status codes.
    - The script should accurately determine if the application is 'up' (functioning correctly) or 'down' (unavailable or not responding).


1. **Mock Server Setup:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory containing `mock_server.py`.
    - Run the mock server script:
      ```
      python mock_server.py
      ```
    - The mock server will start running at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Health Checker Script Execution:**
    - Open a new terminal or command prompt (while the mock server is running).
    - Navigate to the directory containing `application_health_checker.py`.
    - Run the health checker script:
      ```
      python application_health_checker.py
      ```
    - The health checker script will connect to the mock server and simulate both "UP" and "DOWN" scenarios based on the responses from `/up` and `/down` endpoints.

3. **Additional Notes:**
    - Adjust paths or environment variables as necessary based on your setup.
    - Ensure Python 3.x and necessary packages (`requests`) are installed.
